		<p>I've been making games since 2019. My first game is a narrative-driven first-person adventure. I was inspired by a musical and trying to make a fan game, during which I learnt how to use Unity and how to code C# and how to design the levels and UIs and how to make musics using public domain sheets. And that's the most fantastic journey I've ever experienced. Well, when see it today, that very first game of mine is quite rough. However, it's just at that time, I found my calling. Soon after that, I made my second game, a first-person survival about a stray dog who just lost the loved one trying to survive and rebuild relatedness in an indifferent world, and then the third. I made eight games in the last three and a half years and made friends who share the same passion along the way. Inspirations burst when we communicate with each other using our own vocabularies from different disciplines, and result in explorations of new possibilities of gameplay features and implementations - my ninth game in development is one of them.

<!-- About Me -->
<section id="six">
	<div class="inner">
		<h2 id="content">Hi there, I'm Brie Y. Ren.</h2>
		<p>
			I love creating since I was a little girl. Twenty years before it's creative writing, which was the only thing a good school girl could do in my upbringing. I wrote branches for my novels and let my friends choose between them so as to lead the stories into different endings, from which I got my earliest fun in interactive storytelling. 
			<br>
			I played the first video game in my life in university fifteen years before when I had the first PC of my own and I immediately fell in love with this medium in which interacting initiatively is the key to get the expressions of the creators, unlike any other medium I knew before, and I love this autonomy. 
			<br>
			As a person who began writing when fell in love with reading, I had a fierce passion in making games at the moment I fell in love with playing them. However, that earliest game-making trial of mine in university failed as I couldn't find a person to do the code job, and I never thought I could do it myself. I simply believed the 'common sense' that code is something too difficult for girls, especially those who study Liberal Arts in high school and Finance in university. Though the urge to make games haunted me. 
			<br> 
			<br>
			Luckily, I finally got rid of that ridiculous stereotype which bound me for a decade. After inspired by the 45th Ludum Dare game jam when I saw thousands of hobbyists made their own games in even 48h including female devs, I thought "why can't I?". I downloaded Unity and enrolled Game Design and Development course from MSU on Coursera and began to make my first game. I still didn't have much nerve at that time, just thought there's no harm to try. 
			<br>
			Yet when I really put my hand to making games, I found it's not that difficult as I thought it would be. There're tons of MOOCs and tutorials to get me started, and when I have questions in programming specific features in my project I can always find useful references on Stack Overflow or Unity Forum, not to mention the beautifully architected open source projects on GitHub and Unity Assets Store and the thoughtful insights on Gamasutra and GDC shared by experienced developers to learn from when I'm in pursuit of better design. Why haven't I started programming games earlier becomes the biggest regret in my life. 
			<br>
			I don't know how to express the thrill when I first saw the world in my head come real in my hand. It's like you equipped your dream with wings and make it take flight. And I don't know how to appreciate the true confidence that game-making gives me. I used to thought I was confident, but it's not true, I only had confidence within my profession, and it restricted me to a life I had no wish to live in. Through continuous instant feedbacks, game-making gives me strength and competence to always step out my comfort zone, to learn things that I didn't know before, and apply them together with things I knew to what I'm longing for. 
			<br>
			When talking of instant feedbacks, I'd say game-making is the best game I've ever played in my life. It's easy to reach flow state when programming games, and I have to admit that I'm quite addicted to it. It comforted my soul on tough days and sleepless nights with pure calm and delight. And just like the most fascinating games, there's no simple best answer for all situations when programming games. Therefore it gives me great fun to play with all kinds of possibilities and to find out the most suitable strategy for each specific situation.
			<br>			
			<br>
			In my spare time, I like playing games (real games, not the metophor above). Playing The Sims which I've been played thousands of hours in the last fourteen years can always make me relief, playing OverWatch which I've been played for nine hundreds hours in the past seven years can always make me concentrate, and playing all sorts of recent indie games can always make me filled with inspirations. I also love musicals, I love listen and watch different versions of them to research the subtle difference between each expression approaches. My first game Judas' Trial is largely inspired by musical Jesus Christ Superstar, and a game I'm currently working on Room of Oneself is partly inspired by musical Elisabeth. I like reading a lot. Novels and poems and intro-level textbooks of different disciplines are always my creative fuel. In sunny days I'd like to go for a long walk with my dog who fills my days with endless wonder since I adopted her eight years ago. She's also the Muse of mine. Two of my games, A Stray's Tale and The Way Home, are mainly inspired by her.

		<h2>Here's what I can do:</h2>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
			<h3>Gameplay Programming</h3>
			<p>One of my favorite fields. I love design and implement gameplay features from scratch. Experience on: stackable inventory system, craft system, real-time combat system, character stats and equipment system, combat and non-combat skill system, enemy AI system, character customize system, quest system, chatbot system using LLM, etc.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
			<h3>UI Programming & UX Design</h3>
			<p>Another favorite fields of mine. I like design intuitive and responsive User Interface and HUD with interactive UX design principles as well as implement them through coding UI systems and creating layouts and integrating graphic elements to fit the gameplay and aesthetics of the game. Experience with Unity UGUI and Sprite Editor and TextMesh Pro. </p>
		</div>
		<!-- Break -->
		<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
			<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
			<p>I enjoy organizing code with well-designed architecture and decoupling as much as I can within the cost constraints to reuse and extend easily in future iterations. Using the most suitable design patterns to adapt each project's needs to reach the balance point between extensibility, readability, performance and efficiency is something I'm always strive for. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
			<h3>Rapid Prototyping</h3>
			<p>I love making rapid prototypes to try out new gameplay ideas, especially in the experimental game projects. I write throwaway code for mechanics that I'm just playing with for exploring more possibilities, and write well-architected code for features which prototypes are mainly used for tuning details instead of testing if an idea worth further developing. </p>
		</div>
		<!-- Break -->
		<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
			<h3>Animation Graphs & VFX</h3>
			<p>I enjoy working between tech and art, especially making distinctive artstyles for my games using lighting, post-processing, shaders and particle effects. I also love integrate 3d character animations into games with animation state machines and blend trees to make the game alive.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
			<h3>Debugging</h3>
			<p>Before I began making games I thought I would hate debugging but it turned out I quite enjoy it. The procedure of tracking bugs, figuring out what's happening through writing debug codes and watching feedbacks and collecting clues from the console window, and then fixing them ASAP is kinda like a puzzle game to me. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
			<h3>Skillset</h3>
			<p>Scripting C# Unity <br>Version Control with Git <br>Scrum with Jira <br>Knowledge of Level Design and UX Principles <br>Graphics Design with Photoshop <br>Sound Design with Adobe Audition <br>Creative Writing in Chinese and English </p>
